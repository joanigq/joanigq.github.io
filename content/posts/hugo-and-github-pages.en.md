Having a webpage is pretty important nowadays, but starting off might be difficult for many, specially if you don't wanna use paid services like website builders, and/or pay for a hosting domain. An alternative to all that can be _static site generators_, tools like Hugo (upon which is build this website) that can generate all the proper files for a website, based off a sort of template, then writing posts (_like this one!_) can be done by just writing in Markdown language. For hosting, there's a few free options, but today we'll be exploring GitHub Pages.

This can be a little more coding-oriented than the other options, but it's very flexible, maintainable and, best of all, free!

## Prerequisites
- A confortable coding-oriented text editor and/or enviornment like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](sublimetext.com).
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- A working [Git](https://www.gitforwindows.org) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installation.
- Some basic GitHub knowledge. ([Here is a quickstart!](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart))
- Some basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) knowledge.

Also, I'll be writing all of this for a Windows operating system, but the steps can be easily be translated for Linux operating systems, too. Because of this, I used the packet manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) for installing Hugo.

If you don't wanna use Chocolatey, you can check out the other ways to install it from [their webpage](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

You can confirm that Hugo is properly installed if typing `hugo version` on the Windows shell (CMD) or PowerShell, returns the installed version.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\joan> hugo version
hugo v0.109.0
```

## Set up the working directory

Because we'll want to host the webpage generated by Hugo on GitHub Pages, we need a special GitHub repository.

1) Logged into your account, [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new/), this is where all the webpage's files will be. GitHub will then host your website using the files located there. The name of the repository should be `[USERNAME].github.io`, replacing `[USERNAME]` with your GitHub username, for example `joangq.github.io`.

2) Once the repository is created, clone it into a folder and open it using whatever editor you like.

3) In the repo's folder, run the command

```powershell
hugo new site .\ --force
```

We `--force` the installation, because otherwise we'll get a warning telling us that the directory isn't empty, you should have the `LICENSE`and `README.md` files there as well.

After running the command, a whole file structure should be created.

## Download a Hugo theme

Although we could create a custom theme from the ground up, for a quick start it's best to simply install one. Pick and download one from the [hugo library](https://themes.gohugo.io/) or from somewhere else.

For example, I'm using a modified version of the [`hello-friend-ng`](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.

A very useful tool for installing these themes is **reading** their instructions, which can vary from package to package. In my case, instead of cloning its contents, I  installed it as a git submodule by running the following command, straight from its `README` file:

```powershell
PS ~\joanigq.github.io> git submodule add "https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git" themes/hello-friend-ng
```

## Configure the theme

You'll find that nearly every Hugo theme will talk about changing the contents of the `config.toml` file, which is located in the `[USERNAME].github.io\` folder, if you open it you should see something like this:

```toml
baseURL = 'http://example.org/'
languageCode = 'en-US'
title = 'My New Hugo Site'
```

Luckily, the theme I'm using has an [example file](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) which I can copy-paste into my `config.toml` file. Different themes will have a different setup, but most of them will ask you to change the default `config`.

## Test the website locally

You should pretty much be ready to go! Let's test the site.
First, you should make sure that the field `baseURL` is `localhost`.

```toml
# config.toml
baseURL = 'localhost' # <-- For hosting locally
title   = "Hello Friend NG"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "hello-friend-ng"
# ...
```

Then, run `hugo server` at the root of the directory, like this:
```powershell
PS ~\joanigq.github.io> hugo server    
```
It should print out something like this:
```powershell
Start building sites â€¦

```
Now open up your preferred browser, and type `http://localhost:1313` directly in the address bar, your website should show up! If it does, then you're basically done, now let's customize it!

## Customize your website

This is a content-oriented theme, which means that if you downloaded it, you'll probably be writing posts. The way Hugo works is that you write your posts in Markdown inside `/content/` and then Hugo automatically builds a page using templates located in the `/archetypes/` folder. To use the theme's templates, copy all the contents of `/themes/[THEME]/archetypes` into `/archetypes/`, replacing the necessary files.
